# For Squid

We call Book Squid members 'Squid': the great shoal of beautiful creatures who hold new books safely, and help them reach new homes. If you love the work of a particular author or publisher, or if you just love books, you're a potential Squid.

## How does it work?

1. Sign up by joining [the Book Squid group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/453029221574430/).
2. When publishers offer books to our members, we'll let the group know. Members will be able to buy 5 or more copies at a time from the publisher at half price.
3. You're expected to keep those copies safe until someone wants to buy them. You can give or sell them to anyone at any time and at any price you choose.
4. When someone's looking for a book on Book Squid, we'll let the group know. If you're able to get them a copy (if you live close to them, for instance), we'll connect you. From there, the transaction is only between you and the buyer â€“ we don't get involved.

For now, Book Squid is an experiment in peer-to-peer book distribution, as an alternative to traditional, warehouse-based distribution.
