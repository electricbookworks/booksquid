# How does it work?

1. Sign up by joining [our group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/453029221574430/).
2. When publishers offer books to our members, we'll let the group know. Members will be able to buy 5 or more copies at a time from the publisher at half price.
3. You're expected to keep those copies safe until someone wants to buy them. You can give or sell them to anyone at any time and at any price you choose.
4. When someone's looking for a book, we'll let the group know. If you're able to get them a copy (if you live close to them, for instance), we'll connect you. From there, the transaction is only between you and the buyer â€“ we don't get involved.

For now, this is an experiment in peer-to-peer book distribution, as an alternative to traditional, warehouse-based distribution.
