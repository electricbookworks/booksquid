# P2P book distribution

For craft publishers of your favourite books, traditional distribution is impossibly expensive. Now *you* can be a part of the solution.

As a member, you're a tiny warehouse and bookstore. You buy books at half price, and hold them safe for future buyers. When someone wants a book you're keeping safe, we'll connect you. You decide how much to charge for it, so you can always make your money back.
