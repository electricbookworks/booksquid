# P2P book distribution

For craft publishers of your favourite books, traditional distribution is impossibly expensive. Now *you* can be a part of the solution. As a Book Squid, you buy small quantities of books at half price, and hold them safe for future buyers near you. When a book lover wants the book you're keeping safe, we'll connect you. You decide how much to charge them for it, so you can always make your money back.

Peer-to-peer book distribution means no warehouses, no 'out of stock'.
