# For Publishers

Book Squid is as easy as selling printed books. No contracts or ongoing commitments.

Before your next print run, tell us about your book. For instance, [email us](mailto:hi@booksquid.com) your standard Advance Information sheet. We'll pass it on as-is to our members, who will order from you.

Your offer to Book Squid members ('Squid') is that they can buy 5 or more copies at half price. Our members buy directly from you â€“ no interference from us. It's highly recommended that you:

1.	make it extremely easy for our members to buy from you (for instance, offer instant online payments and cheap, fast shipping); and
2.	individually plastic-wrap each copy, since they'll be storing and distributing the books singly in private homes, not fancy warehouses.

Once they have their books from you, your sale is made, and your job is done.

Squid are then expected to keep some or all of those copies safely, until we connect them with book buyers nearby. Once connected, Squid can give or sell their copies to the buyer on their own terms.

We do not dictate how books are sold or for how much. We only connect Publishers, Squid, and potential book buyers, in order to make it easier for people to get hold of new books.
